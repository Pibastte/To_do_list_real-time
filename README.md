how to use this app on your computer:

- first you need to have node.js and npm installed
- then open a terminal window in the project's folder
- type in "npm install" to install the dependencies of the project
- then type "node app.js"
- you can now open your prefered navigator and type in the url bar "http://localhost:8080"
- start by adding a few things that you want to do in your day, then close the window and reopen an other one. You can see that everything you wrote is still on the server.

I made this simple web app to get familiar with node.js, and especially session management. It is part of my learning of javascript, node.js and web development.
